# Getting Started #

Welcome to our software developer kit! This kit contains all the tools and resources you need to build and integrate our
software into your own projects. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, our SDK makes it easy to
take advantage of the powerful functionality our software has to offer. With detailed documentation, sample code, and
technical support, you'll be able to get up and running in no time. We can't wait to see what you'll create with our
SDK!

## Dependencies

You will need one of these packaging tools installed on your machine to get started started. All other dependencies are
loaded by the package manager:

[![Git][Git.ico]][Git.url]
[![npm][NPM.ico]][NPM.url]

The scope of installation of a package manager is beyond the scope of the document.
