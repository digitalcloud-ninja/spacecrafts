# Introduction

Welcome to our software developer kit! This kit contains all the tools and resources you need to build and integrate our
software into your own projects. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, our SDK makes it easy to
take advantage of the powerful functionality our software has to offer. With detailed documentation, sample code, and
technical support, you'll be able to get up and running in no time. We can't wait to see what you'll create with our
SDK!

- The **API Specification** provides a detailed description of the application's API endpoints and their inputs
  and outputs.

- The **Application Users Guide** provides instructions on how to use the sample applications, including features and
  functionality.

- The **Services Reference** provides instructions on how to use the sample application's microservices backend. including
  features and functionality.

- The **Additional Resources** contains additional informational public resources.

- The **Release Notes** provides information on the latest updates and changes to the application.
  This document is intended for developers, administrators, and users of the application.

**Why was this created?**

- **Tutorial / Educational**: This started as a research effort on Postman Enterprise, .git integrations and building
  a developer portal.
- **Template for a Software Developer's Kit**: Being "Agile" and having an SDK allows for quick prototyping of concepts,
  while maintaining "high-quality" code.
  - _**Consistency:**_ Setting up a project correctly from the start, can be tedious and when you're just prototyping
    it's not usually worth the effort for something being thrown away. However, this is a crucial effort of any
    project. Having an SDK solves this, by establishing a "Contract" for a project.
  - _**Best Practices:**_ Establish some "Conventions" or standards for development.
  - _**Ease of Use:**_ It's gotta be easy, or no one will use it. (K.I.S.S)
- **Lead by Example:** Showing an example of documenting code.
